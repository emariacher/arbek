### An Anthill simulation SBT project which uses macros (Scala 2.12, SBT 0.13)

Huge thanks to :
* Paul Butcher (https://github.com/paulbutcher/ScalaMock/blob/typemacros/project/Build.scala) and Adam Warski (https://github.com/adamw/scala-macro-debug) whose SBT projects I used as prototypes for this one.
* Li Haoyi https://github.com/lihaoyi for reusing his sourcecode library which replaced and improved some scala macros functionalities now deprecated
