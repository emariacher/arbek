have the caliber table exported to excel

1 export caliber table to xml
2 run xsltproc with calibertable.xsl (use dozejob)
3 change all ss_ by ss:
4 delete all xmlns=""
5 open the file with excel

if you use calibertable3.xsl (dozejob3.bat) you can directly open the file with excel i.e. no steps 3 and 4 needed anymore.
