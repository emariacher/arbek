TV/movie frequency lists
This is a frequency count of words in a collection of TV and movie scripts/transcripts, primarily downloaded from the Internet.
    * The total number of words counted is: 29,213,800.
    
step 1: install Java Version 6 available @ http://www.java.com
step 2: run Matrix2 java program
 * you need a matrix.csv, fnmatrix.csv and Wiktionary Frequency listsTV20061-1000.txt files
 * output is in out_* file in same directory



in Czar exemple HE is counted 2 times vs [HE ] and [ HE] which is OK because it's 2 different occurences.
